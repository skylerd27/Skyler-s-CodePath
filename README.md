Favorite Applications: iMessage, Music App, GarageBand

iMessage is my number one most used application on iOS. My favorite features include the response gestures, group messages, and pinning favorite contacts to the top of the home view.

Apple Music is defintely my second most used application on iOS. Favorite features include streaming any song I want at the touch of a button, curated playlists, and integration with Siri.


Next up is GarageBand. My favorite features include seamless integration with Logic Pro on my Mac, high quality instrument samples, and the intuitive GUI.

My idea for an iOS app is called BusTrack(name work in progress). This app is specifically for High School and Middle School Transit users. Growing up in a rural town with unpredictable Bus schedules, I would often miss the bus because the window for arrival could range from anywhere in a 30 minute period. This app notifies you when the Bus is arriving at a given pick up location. For privacy and safety reasons, the app is only accesable to Staff and students. The app will ping the location of other students or staff on the bus that use the app, to let you know where the bus is in relation to you, and send you a notification when it is close.
